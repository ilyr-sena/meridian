"""H.264 streaming service: engages the iUS Probe app's WebSocket stream.

The probe app (ProbeApp/H264Stream.swift) handles hardware H.264 encode on
the device. From here we just need to (1) make sure the app is launched,
(2) publish its WebSocket stream so clients can consume it.

This module does NOT serve the frontend; it only makes sure the app has a
working stream ready. The probe app itself serves :9200 (MJPEG + H264 WS)
and serves /stream.html for browser playback.
